## A simple local task management app for android devices from android 11+.

- The app allows you to create and manage users on the app using a local sqlite database
- For each user, you may create lists with unique names and colors, in addition to your personal day, important and planned lists.
- You may export and import or share lists of other users, which will statically copy or dynamically update respective to your choice.
- Inside each list you may add tasks and specify due date, importance, text, notes which will add them to your personal day, important or planned lists depending on your changes

This project uses a MVC model design pattern and was made for my highschool project in 2022.
